## NATURAL SELECTION SIMULATOR
Consider a simulator for natural selection with the following simplified simulation model:

- All the individuals belong to the same species
- The initial population is equal to P
- The reproduction rate for each individual is $\lambda$
- The lifetime $\text{LF}(k)$ of individual $k$ whose parent is $d(k)$ is distributed according to the following distribution:

$ \text{LF}(k) = U[\text{LF}(d(k)),\text{LF}(d(k))\cdot(1+\alpha)] $ with probability $\text{prob}_\text{improve} \newline$
$ \text{LF}(k) = U[0,\text{LF}(d(k))] $ with probability $1-\text{prob}_\text{improve} \newline$
where $\text{prob}_\text{improve}$  is the probability of improvement for a generation and $\alpha$ is the improvement factor (>=0)

Answer to the following questions:

1. Describe some interesting questions to address based on the above simulator.
2. List the corresponding output metrics.
3. Develop the simulator
4. Define some interesting scenario in terms of input parameters.
5. Show and comment some numerical results addressing the above questions.
