## Student Career
Develop a simulator to evaluate the graduation time and the final grade at a MSc course.

* Explain in details the random elements in the simulated system
* Explain all the input parameters
* Explain all all the output metrics
* Explain all the main data structures
* Explain some interesting correlations between output metrics and input parameters
* For the simulation, use realistic values for all the parameters.

You must produce a document with all the answers, with no more than 2 pages.
