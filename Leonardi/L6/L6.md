## LAB G6 - Dynamic processes on graphs - part II
### Study properties of  the dynamic processes over graphs.

Consider a voter model over a $G(n,p)$ with  n chosen in the range $[10^3, 10^4]$  (in such a way that simulation last a reasonable time i.e. 5~10 min at most) and $p_g= 10/n$.

According to the initial condition, each node  has a probability $p_1$  of being in state +1 with $p_1\in {0.51, 0.55, 0.6, 0.7}$.
Evaluate the probability of reaching  a +1-consensus  (if the graph is not connected consider only the giant component). 
Evaluate, as well, the time needed to reach consensus.
 
Then consider a voter model over finite portion of $Z^2$ and $Z^3$.
Fix $p_1=0.51$ and, for 2 or 3 values of $n\in[10^2, 10^4]$, estimate, as before, the probability of reaching  a +1-consensus and the time needed to reach consensus.

Deliver the code along with a brief report, in which you present and comment your results. Are the obtained results in line with  theoretical predictions?
