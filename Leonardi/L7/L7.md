## Lab L7: Epidemic processes - Not evaluated

The goal of Lab L7 is to define and simulate simple strategies to  control an  epidemic (SIR) process through non pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. by introducing mobility restrictions).

* Consider a homogeneous population of 50M individuals. 
* Fix $R(0)=4$ and $\gamma=1/14$ days (recovering rate).    
* Assume that $10\%$ of the infected individuals  needs to be Hospitalized ($H$) and $6\%$ must undergo Intensive Treatments ($IT$).
* Fix the fatality rate of the epidemic to $3\%$.
* $H$ and $IT$ places are limited to 10k and 50k, respectively. 
* Design some non pharmaceutical intervention strategy that avoids $H$ and $IT$ overloads, and limits the number of death in 1 year to 100K.
* To design your strategy you can use a mean-field SIR model.

Then, once you have defined your strategy simulate both the stochastic SIR and its mean field:

* Are there significant differences? Why? 
* What happens if you scale down your population N to 10K (of course you have to scale down also other parameters, such as $H$ and $IT$ places)?
