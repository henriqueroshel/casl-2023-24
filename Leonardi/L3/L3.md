## Random Variables Generator
Write a function that generates  RVs distributed as follows: 
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_distribution">**Rayleigh**</a> $(\sigma)$ 
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_distribution">**Lognormal**</a> $(\mu, \sigma^2)$
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">**Beta**</a> $\Beta(\alpha, \beta)$ distributed random variable, with $\alpha>1$ and $\beta>1$,
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution">**Chi-square**</a> $\chi^2(n)$;   $n\ge1$ <br>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_distribution">**Rice distribution**</a> $(\nu,\sigma)$  for $\nu\ge0$; $\sigma>=0$


For one of the previously listed RVs, test  your generator by: evaluating  the empirical first two moments you obtain after $n\in \set{100,10000,100000}$ random extractions, and comparing them with analytical predictions.  In addition compare also the empirical CDF/PDF to the analytical one.

Write a brief report in which you describe and justify  the method/algorithm you have used. In addition report the outcomes of your test.
